Hi {toEmail},

Thank you for trying out Curator! Here are a few of the things you can do:
   - Check news stories for bias automatically! Post a URL and our algorithm detects level of bias, normalized so you can compare articles.
   - See what the latest news stories are and how they compare by logical errors and factual errors.
   - Analyze articles and contribute to a growing body of news analysis.

You have access to over a thousand articles already analyzed for bias within Curator. Come back frequently and enjoy a more nuanced perspective.

Sincerely,

Curator Admin
